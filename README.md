A structured, beginner-friendly roadmap with **modules, resources, and projects** to go from:
- **Zero → Data Scientist**
- **Zero → AI Engineer (GenAI + RAG + Agents)**

> This is a living roadmap. PRs are welcome!

---

## How to use this repo (simple)
1. Start with **docs/00-start-here.md**
2. Pick a track:
   - **Track A:** Data Science first → then AI Engineering
   - **Track B:** AI Engineering first → fill DS fundamentals in parallel
3. Build projects from **projects/projects.md** as you learn.

---

## Tracks

### Track A — Data Science → ML → AI Engineering
- Math + Stats foundations
- Python + Data analysis
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- GenAI (LLMs, RAG, Agents)
- MLOps + Deployment

### Track B — AI Engineering → DS fundamentals (parallel)
- Prompting + API usage
- RAG + Vector DB basics
- Agents + Tool use
- Then strengthen: Stats, ML evaluation, experimentation
