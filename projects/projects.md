# Projects

This section outlines a series of projects to help you apply the skills from each module of the roadmap. Start with the beginner projects and progress to more challenging ones as you learn.

## Beginner Projects

- **Titanic Survival Prediction** – Use a Kaggle dataset to predict passenger survival using basic data analysis and machine learning (classification).
- **House Price Prediction** – Build a regression model to estimate house prices using features like area, bedrooms, and location.
- **Iris Classification** – Classify iris flowers using the classic Iris dataset and evaluate model accuracy.

## Intermediate Projects

- **Movie Recommendation System** – Use user-rating data to build a collaborative filtering or content-based recommendation system.
- **Customer Churn Analysis** – Predict which customers are likely to churn using telecom or subscription data.
- **Sentiment Analysis** – Analyze customer reviews or social media comments to determine sentiment (positive/negative/neutral).

## Advanced Projects

- **End-to-End ML Pipeline** – Build and deploy a machine learning model with a proper data pipeline, model training, API deployment (FastAPI or Flask), and monitoring.
- **Image Recognition with Transfer Learning** – Fine-tune a pre-trained convolutional neural network (e.g., ResNet or MobileNet) on a custom image dataset.
- **GenAI Chatbot with RAG** – Create a question-answering chatbot that retrieves relevant documents using a vector database and generates responses with a language model (RAG approach).

Feel free to expand on these ideas, adapt them to your interests, or contribute additional projects via pull requests.
