# Roadmap

This roadmap is organized into 10 modules. Do them in order for best results.

## 00 — Start Here
- Setup: Git, GitHub, VS Code/Jupyter, Python env
- How to learn effectively (notes + mini-projects)

## 01 — Math for ML (practical)
- Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, dot product)
- Calculus basics (derivatives, gradients)
- Probability basics (random variables, distributions)

## 02 — Python for Data Work
- NumPy, Pandas
- Writing clean functions, debugging
- Plotting (Matplotlib)

## 03 — Statistics (the useful core)
- Mean/variance, sampling
- Hypothesis testing (t-test intuition)
- Confidence intervals
- A/B testing basics

## 04 — Data Analysis & Storytelling
- EDA patterns
- Feature understanding
- Visualization that answers questions

## 05 — Machine Learning
- Regression, classification
- Bias/variance
- Cross-validation
- Metrics (precision/recall, ROC-AUC)

## 06 — Deep Learning
- Neural nets, backprop intuition
- CNN basics
- Transfer learning

## 07 — GenAI
- LLM basics (tokens, context, temperature)
- Prompt patterns
- Embeddings
- Fine-tuning overview (when/why)

## 08 — RAG + Agents (AI Engineering core)
- Chunking, retrieval, re-ranking
- Vector DB concepts
- Tool use + function calling
- Agent design patterns + guardrails

## 09 — MLOps + Deployment
- Model packaging
- APIs (FastAPI/Flask)
- Monitoring basics
- Reproducibility basics

## Outcome
You should have 6–12 portfolio projects + a clear narrative of your learning.
